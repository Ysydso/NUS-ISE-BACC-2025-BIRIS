# NUS-ISE-BACC-2025-BIRIS

Repository of team BRIIS for the NUS-ISE BACC pre-university category.

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts that use linear and nonlinear optimization. Each file corresponds to a different quarter or scenario. The scripts rely on NumPy and SciPy libraries to solve optimization problems.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed (version 3.7+).
2. Clone (or download) this repository.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run any of scripst by specifying its filename, for example:
    python 1biv.py
6.The scripts will display optimization results and verification details.

Notes
- Each script solves a unique optimization problem.

- Adjust initial guesses, bounds, or constraints if you encounter infeasibility or suboptimal solutions.

- The code is set up to print a summary of the solutions, objective values, and constraint satisfaction checks.
